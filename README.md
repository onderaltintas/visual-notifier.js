-Mario jump mechanics, have read a lot of articles and implemented half arsed. Will be in character class soon.<br/>
-Movement sprite instead of loading animation frames one by one. Because it blows when you deploy it as website (downloading times)... Also helps performance.<br/>
-Shaping up domain model.<br/>
